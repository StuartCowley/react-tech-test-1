## What would I do with more time?

- I would like to format CSS to allow user to view image full screen
- I would like to format the page to provide suitable viewing on mobile devices

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
